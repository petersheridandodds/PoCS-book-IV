  \textbf{Complicated versus Complex:}
      Complicated: Mechanical watches, airplanes, ...
     
      Engineered systems can be made to be \alertr{highly robust
        but not adaptable}.
    
      But engineered systems can become complex (power grid, planes).
     
      They can also \alertr{fail spectacularly}.
     
      Explicit distinction: \alertb{Complex Adaptive Systems}.

      A while ago:
      \wordwikilink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex\_systems}{The
        Wikipedia on Complex Systems:}
    }
    ``Complexity science is not a single theory: 
    it encompasses more than one theoretical framework and is highly
    interdisciplinary, seeking the answers to some fundamental questions
    about living, adaptable, changeable systems.''

    ``Complex systems present problems both in mathematical modelling
and philosophical foundations. The study of complex systems represents
a new approach to science that investigates how relationships between
parts give rise to the collective behaviors of a system and how the
system interacts and forms relationships with its environment.''
  \textbf{Definitions}

  \textbf{
      \alertb{Nino Boccara} in \textit{Modeling Complex Systems}:}\cite{boccara2004a}
    ``... there is no universally accepted definition
    of a complex system ... most researchers would describe
    a system of connected agents that exhibits
    an emergent global behavior not imposed by a central
    controller, but resulting from the interactions between
    the agents.''
  \textbf{\alertb{Philip Ball} in \textit{Critical Mass}:}\cite{ball2004a}
    ``...complexity theory seeks to understand how order and 
    stability arise from the interactions of many components
    according to a few simple rules.''
%%   \textbf{\alertb{Steve Strogatz} in \textit{Sync}:}
%%     ``... every decade or so, a grandiose theory comes along, bearing
%%     similar aspirations and often brandishing an ominous-sounding
%%     C-name. In the 1960s it was cybernetics. In the '70s it was
%%     catastrophe theory. Then came chaos theory in the '80s and complexity
%%     theory in the '90s.''
%%   

%%   \textbf{\alertb{Cosma Shalizi:}}
%%     ``The "sciences of complexity" are very much a potpourri, and while the
%%     name has some justification---chaotic motion seems more complicated
%%     than harmonic oscillation, for instance---I think the fact that it
%%     is more dignified than "neat nonlinear nonsense" has not been the
%%     least reason for its success.---That opinion wasn't exactly changed
%%     by working at the Santa Fe Institute for five years.''

  \textbf{A working definition of a \alertb{Complex System}:}
      Distributed system of many interrelated (possibly networked) parts
      with no centralized control
      exhibiting 
      emergent behavior---`More is Different'\cite{anderson1972a}
  \textbf{Other features/aspects:}
      Explicit nonlinear relationships.
    
      Presence of feedback loops.
    
      Being open or driven, opaque boundaries.

      Systems are ubiquitous and systems matter.
    
      Consequently, much of science is about understanding
      how pieces dynamically fit together.
    
      1700 to 2000 = Golden Age of Reductionism:\newline
      Atoms!, sub-atomic particles, DNA, genes, people, ...
    
      Understanding and creating systems (including new `atoms')
      is the greater part of science and engineering.
    
      \wordwikilink{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality\_(dynamical_systems)}{Universality}: systems with quantitatively different micro details
      exhibit qualitatively similar macro behavior.
    
      Computing advances make the Science of Complex Systems possible:
        We can measure and record enormous amounts of data,
        research areas continue to transition from data scarce to data rich.
      
        We can simulate, model, and create complex systems
        in extraordinary detail.
