Add to size distributions:
    Let's generalize the preceding question so
    that $100q$ percent of the population
    holds $100(1-r)$ percent of the wealth.

    Show $\gamma$ depends on $p$ and $q$ as 
    $$
    \gamma
    =
    1 +
    \frac{\ln \frac{1}{(1-q)}}
      {\ln\frac{1}{(1-q)} - \ln \frac{1}{r}}.
    $$
    (Check this agrees with your result
    for the previous question by setting
    $q=4/5$ and $r=1/5$.

    Is every pairing of $q$ and $r$ possible?

Moby Dick

Maurice Sendak

\url{http://www.believermag.com/issues/201211/?read=interview\_sendak}

MS: It's a nice book. It's perfectly nice. I can't complain about
it. I remember Herman Melville said, ``When I die no one is going to
mention Moby-Dick. They're all going to talk about my first book,
about fucking maidens in Tahiti.'' He was right. No mention of
Moby-Dick then. Everyone wanted another Tahitian book, a beach
book. But then he kept writing deeper and deeper and then came
Moby-Dick and people hated it. The only ones who liked it were Mr. and
Mrs. Nathaniel Hawthorne. Moby-Dick didn't get famous until 1930.
